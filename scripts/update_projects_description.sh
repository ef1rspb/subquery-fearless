BASE_DESCRIPTION="This project are indexing the blockchain and provides an API to retrieve information about the operations. It is used by the Nova Wallet project to fetching transaction history. </br>
It can also be used for your own purposes too! </br>
</br>
‚ö†Ô∏è  Make sure that you add filters and sorting rules to your queries  ‚ö†Ô∏è
</br>
</br>
üóí  That project provide access to information about all transfers and extrinsics. To receive that information you can use: </br>
query {historyElements{nodes{transfer extrinsic}}}
</br>"

ORML_DESCRIPTION="</br>
‚öôÔ∏è This network also uses orml pallet for transfer assets and we proced it too! You can get the information about the orml assets transfer by using query like that:
</br>
query {historyElements{nodes{assetTransfer}}}
</br>"

ASSETS_DESCRIPTION="</br>
‚öôÔ∏è This network also uses Assets pallet for transfer assets and we proced it too! You can get the information about the Assets transfer by using query like that:
</br>
query {historyElements{nodes{assetTransfer}}}
</br>"

STAKING_DESCRIPTION="</br>
ü™ô In that network has staking events on which you can get. For getting history of rewards you can use this one:
</br>
query {historyElements{nodes{reward}}}
</br>
</br>
ü•û Also we are collecting information about accumulated staking which include rewards and slashes, you can request it by using:
</br>
query {accumulatedRewards{nodes{id amount}}}
</br>"

STAKING_ANALITIC="</br>
üßæ As it is collected for rewards it also collected for user stake and you can get it by using this one:</br>
query {accumulatedStakes{nodes{id amount}}}
</br> </br>

üë®‚Äçüîß For getting an information about validators you can request it by:
</br>
query {eraValidatorInfos{nodes{address era total own others}}}
</br> </br>

üìà History about your stake changes is available by request:
</br>
query {stakeChanges{nodes{blockNumber extrinsicHash address amount accumulatedAmount type}}}
